# Handwritten-Alphabets-Recognition

This code helps you recognize Handwritten English Alphabets using Convnets with an accuracy above 99%

Handwritten A-Z Alphabet Dataset from Kaggle was used to train the model. It was further used to develop a program to recognize Handwritten Text on paper and is totally suitable for real-life examples. The dataset had 3,72,450 (28x28 px) images with 26 Labels (A-Z). Out of these 0.1% was used for validation and testing each.

Keras API with Tensorflow in the backend was used to build the Deep Neural Network. OpenCV was used to detect multiple alphabets in a single image using Contours.

Training Accuracy: 99.02%

Validation Accuracy: 99.19%

Test Accuracy: 99.44%
